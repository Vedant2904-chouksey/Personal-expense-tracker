# Problem Statement

Many individual find it difficult to track and manage their daily expenses and income efficiently or easily.
Traditional methods such as hard copy records or spreadsheets are tiresome, easily error prone, and lack real-time insights.
This makes budgeting, spending control, and financial planning difficult, resulting in poor financial decisions and lack of awareness about spending patterns.
